# Changelog

## v0.12.0 — 2026-04-14

- Add `/status` command — lightweight deployment status check for non-coder users
- Read-only: reports whether the site is up without switching branches, stashing, or attempting fixes
- Checks both production and preview deployments with health checks
- Points users to `/deploy` when issues are found

## v0.11.2 — 2026-04-14

- `/deploy` now restores stashed changes after the deploy check completes — returns you to your original branch and working tree

## v0.11.1 — 2026-04-14

- `/deploy` now stashes uncommitted changes instead of blocking — no more "run `/save` first" interruptions

## v0.11.0 — 2026-04-14

- Add `/suggestions` skill — analyzes your PR and suggests prioritized next tasks (security, bugs, features, etc.)
- `/close` now runs suggestions before merge and optionally tracks them in `docs/todos/backlog.md`
- Backlog preference system — choose "always update", "always ask", or "skip" via `hypt-config`

## v0.10.1 — 2026-04-14

- Add auto-update check to `/start` — now all skills check for hypt updates before running

## v0.10.0 — 2026-04-14

- `/start` is now idempotent — detects fully onboarded projects and exits early with next-step suggestions
- Partial-resume support — if the plan exists but setup is incomplete, skips idea questions and repairs only what's missing
- Install scripts and README now guide AI agents to run `/start` after installation

## v0.9.2 — 2026-04-14

- Add MIT license to the project

## v0.9.1 — 2026-04-14

- Add update-check preamble to `/deploy` and `/close` for consistency with all other skills
- Extract Vercel team access bypass into standalone `bin/hypt-vercel-bypass` script

## v0.9.0 — 2026-04-14

- `/deploy` now falls through to production when no PR exists — non-coder users can deploy latest `main` from any branch
- Ignores local uncommitted changes when checking production deployment status

## v0.8.0 — 2026-04-14

- Auto-bypass Vercel TEAM_ACCESS_REQUIRED in `/deploy` and `/close` — detects when Vercel blocks deployments on free plans and deploys via CLI with a temporary author swap on a detached HEAD
- Hardened bypass with dirty-tree checks, detached HEAD isolation, empty-variable guards, and fallback author chain

## v0.7.0 — 2026-04-14

- Auto-generate CHANGELOG.md as part of `/close` version bump

## v0.6.0 — 2026-04-14
